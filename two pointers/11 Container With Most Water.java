//When you consider a1 and aN, then the area is (N-1) * min(a1, aN). The base (N-1) is the maximum possible.
//This implies that if there was a better solution possible, it will definitely have the Height greater than min(a1, aN), which means the minimum is greater, so we discard the smaller one, If a1Â < aN, then the problem reduces to solving the same thing for a2, aN.  Else, it reduces to solving the same thing for a1, aN-1
